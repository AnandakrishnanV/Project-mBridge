# To Do
- Blacklisting Whitelisting
  - Functions to Add
    - Change Foreign Currency Internal CUrrency STatus - Apply to All
      - Trigger when you need to restrict all foreign users
        - After setting foreign country internal restrictions, User the secondaryUserCountryUsers mapping, secondaryUserAddresses mapping and secondaryUserStatus mapping with a for loop to set all country users status to new status
        - will be used by Japan to Block all Indian wallets now and then unlock them in a later date
    - Change UserStatus
      - Change user status in primaryUserStatus or Secondary User Status
        - Used to restrict a particular address
        - WIll be overwritten by if status for a whole country is changed
      - Can use same function for both primary and secondary users for now. There are issues though. Mapping will give 0 as status for non-existent address and this means we are currently using 0 for blocked. so if mapping is 0, is it a blocked primary user or a secondary user who has valid status elsewhere.
    - Request_block_address
      - India request Japan to block an indians account
      - Jap check if request is from india and account is indian before blocking
- Pooling
  - Will need banks to hold each others currencies. Which is another layer of complexities.
  - Can have banks as special addresses instead of retail users
  - Handled by Bank of Banks ? easiest method
  - Indian wants to exchange INR for JPY.
    - Requests a central bank - ex INDIA
      - Central bank checks if it has enough INR and JPY for the exchange. Executes if it has both. else does not
    - Can have BankOfBanks hold a for loop
      - Rotate though all banks and request transfer, hopefully 1 bank has both isde balance. exchanges.
      - Pooling and internal tranferring seems very complicated.
